### 1. What is your project, and what problem does it solve?

FVM-Explore allows developers to **Compile, Deploy, Verify and Interact with Smart contracts** on the FVM-Chain with an easy-to-use interface and interactive experience . It also provides developers with APIs to build on top of the platform .

It is a Native Developer Tooling and Infrastructure application for the FVM Ecosystem focussing to provide the best Developer experience . Developers no longer need to Create Scripts and Write tests to interact with the deployed contracts.

### Notes

We are also interested in applying for a Request for Proposals under the FVM Tooling and infrastructure category . We have a lot of other features planned , to make the platform even better for developers . Some of them are :

- Command Line tool ( CLI ) access to the full platforms and it's feature right from scratch on the command line
- Customisation with support of different compiler versions and fully interactive coding IDE environment

These could be discussed further , as these features will take much more time and effort.
